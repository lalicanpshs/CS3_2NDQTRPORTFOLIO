    <br><p>Ice cream, a refreshing summer treat cherished by many people. But have you ever wondered how far ice cream has come? Well, wonder no more! We'll be diving deep into the sweet world of ice cream, starting of with the most important thing, that is...</p>
    <h1>History of Ice Cream</h1>
    <p><text style ="font-size: 20px;">Ice cream has come a long way from its earliest beginnings. It first appeared in China during the Tang dynasty, where milk was mixed with rice and chilled using snow. Over time, this idea spread to Europe, and by the 16th century, sweetened frozen dairy or "ices" became popular, later evolving into sorbets. As centuries passed, the first hand-cranked freezer was invented in the early 19th century, giving ice cream a smoother texture and making it easier to produce.</p>
    
    <p><text style ="font-size: 20px;">Soon after, factories in New York and Boston began mass-producing ice cream during the mid-1800s, marking the start of its industrial rise. With the invention of mechanical refrigeration, ice cream could now be stored and enjoyed year-round, turning it from a luxury to an everyday delight. Finally, innovations like the ice cream cone, introduced at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair, made it more accessible and fun to eat. Overall, what began as a frozen delicacy for the few has transformed into one of the world's most loved desserts.</p>
